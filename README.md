# SCT_WD_2
📖 Project Overview

The Stopwatch Web App is designed to accurately measure elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. It provides an intuitive interface and smooth functionality, making it useful for activities like workouts, study sessions, or productivity tracking.

This project emphasizes logic building, event handling, and real-time UI updates using JavaScript.

✨ Features

✔️ Start the stopwatch
✔️ Pause/Stop the stopwatch
✔️ Reset time to zero
✔️ Record lap times
✔️ Real-time time display updates
✔️ Responsive design for all devices
✔️ Clean and modern user interface
✔️ Smooth button interactions

⚙️ How It Works

JavaScript uses setInterval() to update time every few milliseconds

Time is calculated and displayed in HH : MM : SS : MS format

Event listeners handle Start, Pause, Reset, and Lap button actions

Lap times are dynamically added to the lap list

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned how to:

Work with time-based JavaScript functions (setInterval, clearInterval)

Implement event listeners for user interactions

Update the UI dynamically using DOM manipulation

Build real-time interactive web applications

Structure clean and maintainable frontend code
